 Throughout my educational journey, I've had numerous encounters with computing that have shaped my interests and skills in the field. As a child, I was always intrigued by computers, and I had access to one very early on, with my first encounter with a computer at the age of five. As I grew up, technology became an integral part of my daily life. I enjoyed playing games a lot, but I also picked up tricks here and there.

  I didn’t grow up in Australia, and in my home country, computing was an important and essential subject. I learned HTML in year five as part of the school curriculum. Additionally, we were required to be proficient in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. After moving to Australia, I encountered Chromebooks, which were commonly used in primary schools, giving me plenty of exposure to tech.

   Later in high school, I chose digital technology as an elective in years 9, 10, and 11. Finally, in year 12, I took a VET course in advanced Cybersecurity as part of my SACE accreditation. This course really piqued my interest, and as a result, I decided to further explore cybersecurity by pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, which is where I am currently.

    <h2>Current experience with computing</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, my experience with computing is expanding significantly as I continue to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity. I’m gaining a deep understanding of how systems, networks and digital infrastructures work and how networks communicate. It is very interesting learning how something that’s so prominent in my daily life operates. I’m also learning about various operating systems, experiment with virtual machines, and use tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, and various command-line interfaces to sharpen my skills.
