  <h2>What I want to do with Computing in the future:</h2>

 <p>
  As I continue my studies in Cybersecurity, I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that computing will bring in the future. Considering how rapidly technology is evolving, I'm sure the prospect of Cybersecurity will too and many positions will arise (Inshallah). In the near future, I would want to pursue a career in Cybersecurity, focusing on network security and ethical hacking or even as a Chief Information Security Officer. However, I don't see myself working long-term in this field.

 <h2>Other Plans</h2>
 <img src="images/dino.png" alt="Snoopy in a dino costume" width="150" height="150" style="float: left;">
 <p> In the future, I aim to explore new career paths outside of cybersecurity, focusing specifically on my passion for wildlife biology and zoology. I've always been fascinated by animals and ecosystems and I really really look forward to working with them in the future. I would love to contribute to conservation efforts that would positively impact our ecosystems and potentially prevent endangered species from going extinct.</p>

 <h2>Even more plans</h2>

 <p> 
 Additionally, I also have a dream of eventually opening a bakery, in a remote town preferably in Istanbul. Like I mentioned before, I love love loveeee baking and I would love to share my treats with others. I may even make this bakery specialise in lemon treats as I, personally, am a big fan of lemons. I also want to make it similar to a cat cafe, but instead of cats I may feature another animals. I'll think about the specialisation later.

  <h5>Why am I doing Cybersecurity then?</h5>
  <p>Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy working with technology; however, I do have bigger passions. While I appreciate the challenges and learning opportunities this field may offer, one of the main reasons I'm initially drawn to it is due to its pay potential. That said, I want to pursue my true passions, though they don’t typically offer high salaries. Therefore, I need to build a strong foundation before I explore other fields, and I believe cybersecurity will help me do that.</p>
