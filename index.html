    <p>I have alot of hobbies. I love picking up random skills. Recently, i've been really into tufting and am currently in the process of making a rug for a room. I also enjoy playing the electric guitar, baking and anything involving arts and crafts. Other then that, I love roblox and minecraft.  </p>

    <p>I really mess with music. I have a very diverse music taste, with a whole lot of pop, rap, urdu and hindi music and indie. My current rotation includes The Marías, Saint Levant, Billie Eilish, Talha Anjum, Dominic Fike, Beabadoobee and a whole lot of others.</p>
    <p> I also love love love watching series. Im currently binging the Rookie which I lowkey like. Other than that, my all time favs include Money Heist, Brooklyn 99, UCAD and so so many more (I can't remember right now) </p>

   <h2>Other Things:</h2>
   <p>I recently moved to Sydney from Adelaide, South Australia around two months ago. The move has been significant as Adelaide is way smaller in comparison to Sydney. I've definitely felt a change, especially in terms of the population and traffic in general. Either way, I'm looking forward to what Sydney has to offer.</p>
